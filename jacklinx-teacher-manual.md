# 1 General principles for music education.
The first question to be answered in any music educational setting would be:

### What do we want the kids to do, why and how?

The second question will be in our current endeavour:
### What do we want the kids to do with a computer, why and how?

Music learning is in the first place a multifaceted activity. Music learning and playing involves many human capacities simultaneously:
- listening and hearing
- rational thinking
- emotional imvolvement
- improvisation
- body movement and dance
- singing and vocal expression
- playing instruments
- connecting and communicating with other people
- reading and interpreting visual instructions (scores)
- seeing and interpreting video, dance, movement, animation.

Music education benefits from a rich variety of musicking types. 

From the work of Christopher Small and David Elliot we quote some guiding principles that have been an inspirationfor our own music lessons and for the development of JackLinx and PackPakx:

- music education is a practice
- music education is multifaceted
- multicultural music education asks for immersion in multicultural practice
- music education asks for collective work

# 2 Principles for JackLinx in music education

From these general considerations we could derive specific white paper with activities for a software solution.

The aim of JackLinx is to provide a platform that should be instrumental to submerse the student in a multifacetedmultimedia musical environment that stimulates and challenges the simultaneous use and exercise of various musicaland musicking capacities. Ir should encompass many different musical practices and styles.

The aim of JackPakx is to provide a rich and varied repertoire of music learning material that makes use of the various possibilities of JackLinx. It should encompass many different musical practices and styles.

JackLinx and JackPakx combined should cater for:

- Material and fragments from the music appreciation repertoire to play with.
- Playalong tracks and backing tracks for solo and group playing. 
- Composing 
- Beat making
- Sequencing
